                <h1>Giving Back: Empowering Children through Education</h1>

                <p class="text-justify">At <strong>Dream Big for College</strong>, we are dedicated to transforming the lives of
                    underprivileged
                    children in rural Nepal by providing access to quality education. In many rural areas, children face
                    numerous barriers to education, including financial constraints, a lack of schools, and limited
                    resources.
                    Without access to education, these children are deprived of the opportunities needed to break free
                    from the
                    cycle of poverty. Our mission is to offer these children a chance to succeed through education,
                    which we
                    believe is the most powerful tool for creating long-term change.</p>

                <h2>Our Focused Efforts Include:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class="text-justify"><strong>Scholarships for Children:</strong> We provide financial support to children who are
                        unable to
                        afford schooling, covering tuition fees, uniforms, books, and other essential educational
                        materials. By
                        removing financial barriers, we ensure that every child has the opportunity to attend school.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-justify"><strong>Educational Infrastructure Development:</strong> Many rural areas lack the basic
                        infrastructure
                        required for effective education. We are committed to improving the learning environment by
                        building and
                        renovating schools to create safe, well-equipped spaces for children to learn and grow.</li>
                    <li class="text-justify"><strong>Teacher Training and Resources:</strong> To ensure quality education, we focus on
                        providing
                        training for teachers and equipping them with the necessary resources. By empowering teachers,
                        we raise
                        the standard of education and ensure that children receive the best possible instruction.</li>
                    <li class="text-justify"><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> We work closely with local communities to promote the
                        importance
                        of education, encouraging families to send their children to school and supporting them
                        throughout their
                        educational journey.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text-justify">We believe that education is the key to unlocking a brighter future. By providing these children with
                    the
                    tools and support they need, we are helping them build a path to greater opportunities, personal
                    growth, and
                    a future where they can contribute to the development of their communities.</p>
